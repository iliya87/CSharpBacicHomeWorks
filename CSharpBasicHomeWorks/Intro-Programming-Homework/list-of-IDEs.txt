		1.Eclipse

		Languages: C, C++, Python, Perl, PHP, Java, Ruby and more


		Eclipse is the free and open-source editor upon which many development frameworks are based.
 		It's one of the granddaddies in its field and comes highly recommended by many a professional developer.
 		Eclipse began as a Java development environment and has greatly expanded through a system of lightweight plugins.

		
		2.NetBeans

		NetBeans is neck-and-neck with Eclipse as the most-recommended IDE in this category.
 		It's free and open-source, supports tons of languages with more plugins coming all the time,
 		and is incredibly simple to install and use, even for a beginner.

		
		3.Aptana Studio 3

		If web and scripting languages are more of your style, Aptana is well suited for the task. 
		PHP, Ruby on Rails, and Python are supported as well as the likes of Adobe AIR. Even the 
		studio itself is available as a plugin for Eclipse if you prefer the way Aptana handles 
		your work and want to combine it with a more comprehensive IDE. Aptana Studio 3 is free 
		and available solely under the GNU General Public License.

		4.Gedit
		
		Gedit is the official editor of the gnome desktop and comes installed once the system 
		is setup. Very useful for the user that is casually editing code and not undertaking 
		major projects. This would be a good companion to Netbeans or Eclipse.
		gedit offers the ability to highlight your code and figure out where the bugs are by 
		giving you a fresh perspective. This can also be used for web development, to help 
		developers see where the start of nodes are and where to submit the end nodes, doing 
		this could cut down drastically on XHTML  issues. 
		


		5.Kate

		Kate is exactly how the website describes it, a text editor. Not to be looked down upon 
		as it does a lot more than a regular text edit can do and that is what makes this an 
		indispensable product.
		This is probably one of the best features for kate. [Mike Szczys] explains that there 
		is a small column to the left of the code. Any line that is an opening bracket that 
		column will have an arrow next to it. If you click the arrow it will fold all of the 
		code between the opening and closing brackets. Very useful for large source packages.


		6.Visual Studio

		Visual Studio has an advantage when it comes to programming.
 		This IDE is mostly used by corporate programmers to produce .NET code. 
		Sometimes people want to try the product without investing thousands of dollars first, 
		so Microsoft has the Express editions for all of their products. 
		This makes it perfect for casual users that want to hack out some code as a hobby or programmers who need a free solution to code in C#.
		Be warned though, if the application developed by someone using the express versions of Visual Studio takes off and starts making money
		it would not be surprising to see big brother step in and start asking questions.
